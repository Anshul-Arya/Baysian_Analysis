# Bayesian Analysis using R
Inferential statistical methods help us decide what to believe in. With inferential statistics,
we don’t just introspect to find the truth. Instead, we rely on data from observations. Based
on the data, what should we believe in? Should we believe that the tossed coin is fair if
it comes up heads in 7 of 10 flips? Should we believe that we have cancer when the test
comes back positive? Should we believe that she loves me when the daisy has 17 petals?
Our beliefs can be modified when we have data, and this book is about techniques for
making inferences from data to uncertain beliefs.

There might be some beliefs that cannot be decided by data, but such beliefs are dogmas
that lie (double entendre intended) beyond the reach of evidence. If you are wondering
about a belief that has no specific implications for concrete facts in the observable world,
then inferential statistics won’t help.

### 1. Running Proportion of Heads
Running proportion of heads when flipping a coin. The x-axis is plotted on a logarithmic scale so that you can see the details of the first few flips but also the long-run trend
after many flips. (The R code that generated this graph is in RunningProportion.R.When you run the code,your graph will look different than this one because you will generate a different random sequence of flips.)
